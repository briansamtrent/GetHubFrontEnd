- Hierarchy of item importance - separate categories
- User Authentication
- Incorporating geographic distance in trades offered
- Offer the largest possible multi-person trade
- Swipe left / swipe right
- Visual representation of trades
- Detect possible trades
- Trading through space and time using bartering debt
